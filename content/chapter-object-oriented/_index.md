### What is object oriented programming?

- Analogy to way we interact with objects in real world
- A component-oriented approach
- Promotes reusability

---

### OOP: encapsulation and data abstraction

- Two of the fundamental pillars of OOP
- Data and functions (methods) go together
- Unimportant details of code are hidden

---

### OOP in Python

- Constructors
- Class attributes
- Instance attributes
- Calling class methods
- Magic methods

---

### Class activity: make your own class!

- Teams of 2, pick a marker
- Write code on a board that includes:
{{% fragment %}}
  - A class with a constructor
  - One or more method functions
  - Make sure to have some class attributes that serve a purpose
  - Also have instance attributes
  - Create several instances of the class and call its methods to demonstrate
{{% /fragment %}}

---

### Class activity: now make it on Repl.it

- No teamwork; create a file with your name and put your class in your own fork, by changing example below (not just strings!):

---

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

- The last two fundamental pillars of OOP
- Inheritance: subclasses inherit methods and attributes
- Polymorphism: all subclasses can be used interchangably, regardless of implementation details

---

### Class activity: inherit!

- Follow instructions by forking it.

---

### Class activity: polymorphism

- Teams of 2, pick a marker
- Write code on a board that includes:
  - A parent class and 2-3 child classes
  - Create parent class method to be *overloaded* in the children
  - Implement different versions of method in child classes
  - Demonstrate calling the method in children object instances to show different outcomes
  - Must have a meaning!
